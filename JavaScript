=== takes type of variable in consideration, while == make type correction based upon values of variables: 
Example:
0==false   // true, because false is equivalent of 0
0===false  // false, because both operands are of different type
2=="2"     // true, auto type coercion, string converted into number
2==="2"    // false, since both operands are not of same type
